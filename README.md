# Nick's Brainfuck Interpreter (NBI)

An interpreter for [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), the
(in)famous [esolang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)
created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. This is meant to be a personal learning
exercise so I can develop my understanding of how interpreters work.
